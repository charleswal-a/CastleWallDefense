## Introduction

Welcome to my Castle Wall Defense repository! :wave:

This project is a game that I created for a 3-week long programming competition when I was a junior in high school. The competition was held through my AP Computer Science A course and included a presentation at the end. Since the end of the e

I am very proud of this game as it was my first time planning and executing my own project. It even won first place in the class! :trophy:

Enjoy playing this simple defense game that introduced me to the world of software development!

## Features

Here are some of the features players can experience in the game:

* Shoot down moving entities
* Move along the castle wall to aim at enemies
* Enemies that approach at increasing speeds
* Holding a high score of enemies killed
* Animated enemies and castle barracades
* Listen to music in the title screen and during games
* View a "How To Play" screen
